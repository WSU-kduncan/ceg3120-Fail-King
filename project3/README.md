# Project 3

## VPC
###
1. The VPC reminds me of the router of a home network. The VPC is where you attach all of your rules, subnet masks, and gateways to essentially build a virtual network or cluster.

## Subnet mask
###
1. A subnet mask declares how many digits of the IP are accessible for local devices, determining how many IP's are available on a network.

## Gateway
###
1. The gateway is like its name implies, it is the gateway between the private network and the public network.  All traffic coming in to the and out of the network must pass through the gateway. The gateway converts public ip packets to local ip packets.

## Route Table
###
1. The route table is a table of predefined routes that will be followed when the packets are addressed how the rule states, and it will be sent to the target.

## Security Group
###
1. The security group sets a group set of rules that act much like a firewall would.  These rules can allow ssh traffic or just about any traffic that you know the protocol and/or the port for.
